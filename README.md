Rss reader with pictures and your own custom rss feeds.
Not every rss feed is supported fully now. I've decided to add image support only in those, which use media:thumbnail, media:content or image tags.

So I suggest you to test the app on a default [CNN feed](http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss) or use [BBC feed](http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml). Also, you are able to browse even texty feeds (without images), such as [takiedela.ru](http://takiedela.ru/feed/)
